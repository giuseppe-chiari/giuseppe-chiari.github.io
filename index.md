## About Me

I am a Ph.D. student at *Politecnico di Milano* in Information Technology.
I carry out my research at **[Politecnico di Milano](https://www.polimi.it/)**
advised by [Davide Zoni](https://zoni.faculty.polimi.it/) 
and at  **[Infineon](https://www.infineon.com/)** (Pavia) 
advised by [Hayri Verner Hasou](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hayri/?locale=it_IT).

## Research Interests
My research focuses on exploiting machine and deep learning 
techniques in:
- **analog and mixed signal design automation** (EDA tools)
- **side-channel analysis** (hardware security)
